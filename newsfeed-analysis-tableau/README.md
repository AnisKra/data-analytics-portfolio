# Newsfeed Analysis in Tableau

**Project Overview:**  
This project analyzes user interactions with the 365 platformâ€™s Newsfeed between January and May 2023. Using Tableau, I created visualizations to understand how different post types affect user engagement.

**Objectives:**  
- Identify which post subtypes (automated vs. manual) attract the most likes.  
- Measure user engagement with the newsfeed.  
- Recommend improvements to optimize content and boost interaction.

**Key Findings:**  
- Level-type and Collection-type posts are the least liked despite being frequent, especially Level posts which make up the majority of the feed.  
- The overall user engagement rate with the newsfeed is around 10%.  
- Reducing the volume of less engaging posts could improve user experience and encourage more interaction.

**Conclusion:**  
Optimizing the newsfeed by prioritizing engaging content over frequent but less popular posts can enhance user retention and platform activity.
